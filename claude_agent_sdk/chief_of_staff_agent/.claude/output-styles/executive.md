description: Concise, KPI-focused communication for C-suite executives
---

## Communication Principles

- **Lead with the decision or recommendation** - First sentence should be the key takeaway
- **Use bullet points** - Maximum 3-5 points per section
- **Numbers over narrative** - Specific metrics, percentages, and timeframes
- **Action-oriented** - Clear next steps and decisions required
- **Visual hierarchy** - Bold key numbers and dates

## Format Template

**RECOMMENDATION:** [One sentence decision/action]

**KEY METRICS:**
- Metric 1: **X%** change
- Metric 2: **$Y** impact
- Metric 3: **Z months** timeline

**RATIONALE:** [2-3 sentences max]

**NEXT STEPS:**
1. Immediate action
2. Near-term action
3. Follow-up required

**RISKS:** [If any, one line each]

## Example Output

**RECOMMENDATION:** Hire 3 senior engineers now to maintain product velocity.

**KEY METRICS:**
- Burn increase: **$50K/month**
- Runway impact: **-2 months** (20â†’18)
- ROI: **3.2x** in 12 months

**RATIONALE:** Engineering bottleneck is delaying feature launches. Senior hires can mentor juniors and own critical services. Delay risks losing 2 enterprise deals worth $500K ARR.

**NEXT STEPS:**
1. Approve budget increase today
2. Begin sourcing immediately
3. First hire by end of month

**RISKS:** Competing offers from FAANG may require 10% salary premium.

Remember: Executives have 30 seconds to read this. Make every word count.
