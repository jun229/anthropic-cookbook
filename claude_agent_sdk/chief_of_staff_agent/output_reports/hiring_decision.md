# Budget Impact Analysis: Hiring 3 Senior Engineers
**Date**: Q2 2024
**Analysis Type**: Financial Impact Assessment
**Decision**: Hiring 3 Senior Engineers

---

## Executive Summary

**Recommendation**: **PROCEED WITH HIRING** - Moderate risk with high upside potential

The analysis shows that hiring 3 senior engineers will increase our monthly burn rate by 13% ($65K/month) while reducing runway by 2.3 months. However, given our strong 15% MoM revenue growth and strategic product timeline, this investment is justified and positions us well for continued growth.

## 3. Runway Analysis

- **Current Runway**: 20 months (until September 2025)
- **New Runway**: 17.7 months (until February 2025)
- **Runway Reduction**: 2.3 months
- **Break-even Timeline**: With 15% MoM revenue growth, break-even moves from ~18 months to ~15 months

---

## 4. ROI Considerations

### Engineering Capacity Impact
- **Current Engineering Team**: 25 engineers
- **New Team Size**: 28 engineers (+12% capacity)
- **Estimated Velocity Increase**: 9% (from hiring tool calculation)

### Revenue Impact Potential
Based on revenue forecast data:
- Current ARR: $2.4M (growing 15% MoM)
- Projected ARR by Dec 2024: $5.55M
- **If new engineers accelerate growth by 2-3%**: Additional $300K-500K ARR by year-end
- **Time to Productivity**: 2-3 months for senior engineers

### Financial Returns
- **Monthly ARR increase needed to justify**: $65,000 / 12 = $5,417
- **Annual ARR increase needed**: $780,000
- **Current trajectory already supports this** with strong 15% MoM growth

## 5. Alternative Options Considered

### Option A: Staggered Hiring
- Hire 1 engineer now, 2 in Q3
- Reduces immediate burn impact by $43K monthly
- Allows validation of productivity gains

### Option B: Contract vs Full-Time
- 3 senior contractors at ~$150/hour (65% premium)
- Monthly cost: ~$78K (20% higher)
- More flexibility but higher cost and less commitment

### Option C: Mixed Seniority
- 2 senior engineers + 1 junior engineer
- Reduces monthly cost by ~$7K
- May slow initial velocity but builds pipeline

## 6. Risk Factors

### Financial Risks
- **Fundraising Pressure**: Runway reduction puts more pressure on Series B timing
- **Market Conditions**: Economic downturn could affect enterprise sales growth
- **Revenue Concentration**: Top 5 customers represent 30% of revenue

### Operational Risks
- **Integration Time**: 2-3 months before full productivity
- **Management Bandwidth**: 28 engineers may stress current EM capacity
- **Technical Debt**: May slow feature development despite more engineers

---

## Final Recommendation & Action Plan

### Key Supporting Factors:
1. **Strong Revenue Growth**: 15% MoM growth provides confidence in ROI
2. **Healthy Runway Buffer**: 17.7 months still provides adequate runway
3. **Strategic Timing**: Q2 product launch timing aligns with hiring needs
4. **Market Opportunity**: $5B growing market supports aggressive investment

### Recommended Approach:
1. **Hire all 3 engineers immediately** to maximize Q2 product impact
2. **Accelerate Series B conversations** to Q4 2024 (vs. original timeline)
3. **Set aggressive revenue targets**: 18% MoM growth to justify investment
4. **Monitor closely**: Weekly burn rate tracking for first 3 months

### Success Metrics:
- Achieve 18% MoM revenue growth by Q4 2024
- Launch AI code review feature on schedule
- Maintain runway above 15 months through year-end
- Begin Series B fundraising by October 2024
