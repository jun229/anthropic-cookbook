    "\n",
    "#### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In notebook 00, we built a simple research agent. In this notebook, we'll incrementally introduce key Claude Code SDK features for building comprehensive agents. For each introduced feature, we'll explain:\n",
    "- **What**: what the feature is\n",
    "- **Why**: what the feature can do and why you would want to use it\n",
    "- **How**: a minimal implementation showing how to use it\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are familiar with Claude Code, you'll notice how the SDK brings feature parity and enables you to leverage all of Claude Code's capabilities in a programmatic headless manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this notebook, we'll build an **AI Chief of Staff** for a 50-person startup that just raised $10M Series A. The CEO needs data-driven insights to balance aggressive growth with financial sustainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our final Chief of Staff agent will:\n",
    "- **Coordinate specialized subagents** for different domains\n",
    "- **Aggregate insights** from multiple sources\n",
    "- **Provide executive summaries** with actionable recommendations"

    "### Feature 0: Memory with [CLAUDE.md](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices)\n",
    "\n",
    "**What**: `CLAUDE.md` files serve as persistent memory and instructions for your agent. When present in the project directory, Claude Code automatically reads and incorporates this context when you initialize your agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why**: Instead of repeatedly providing project context, team preferences, or standards in each interaction, you can define them once in `CLAUDE.md`. This ensures consistent behavior and reduces token usage by avoiding redundant explanations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How**: \n",
    "- Have a `CLAUDE.md` file in the working directory - in our example: `chief_of_staff_agent/CLAUDE.md`\n",
    "- Set the `cwd` argument of your ClaudeSDKClient to point to directory of your CLAUDE.md file"

    "### Feature 1: The Bash tool for Python Script Execution\n",
    "\n",
    "**What**: The Bash tool allows your agent to (among other things) run Python scripts directly, enabling access to procedural knowledge, complex computations, data analysis and other integrations that go beyond the agent's native capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why**: Our Chief of Staff might need to process data files, run financial models or generate visualizations based on this data. These are all good scenarios for using the Bash tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How**: Have your Python scripts set-up in a place where your agent can reach them and add some context on what they are and how they can be called. If the scripts are meant for your chief of staff agent, add this context to its CLAUDE.md file and if they are meant for one your subagents, add said context to their MD files (more details on this later). For this tutorial, we added five toy examples to `chief_of_staff_agent/scripts`:\n",
    "1. `hiring_impact.py`: Calculates how new engineering hires affect burn rate, runway, and cash position. Essential for the `financial-analyst` subagent to model hiring scenarios against the $500K monthly burn and 20-month runway.\n",
    "2. `talent_scorer.py`: Scores candidates on technical skills, experience, culture fit, and salary expectations using weighted criteria. Core tool for the `recruiter` subagent to rank engineering candidates against TechStart's $180-220K senior engineer benchmarks.\n",
    "3. `simple_calculation.py`: Performs quick financial calculations for runway, burn rate, and quarterly metrics. Utility script for chief of staff to get instant metrics without complex modeling.\n",
    "4. `financial_forecast.py`: Models ARR growth scenarios (base/optimistic/pessimistic) given the current $2.4M ARR growing at 15% MoM.Critical for `financial-analyst` to project Series B readiness and validate the $30M fundraising target.\n",
    "5. `decision_matrix.py`: Creates weighted decision matrices for strategic choices like the SmartDev acquisition or office expansion. Helps chief of staff systematically evaluate complex decisions with multiple stakeholders and criteria."

    "\n",
    "**What**: Output styles allow you to use different output styles for different audiences. Each style is defined in a markdown file.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why**: Your agent might be used by people of different levels of expertise or they might have different priorities. Your output style can help differentiate between these segments without having to create a separate agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How**:\n",
    "- Configure a markdown file per style in `chief_of_staff_agent/.claude/output-styles/`. For example, check out the Executive Ouput style in `.claude/output-styles/executive.md`. Output styles are defined with a simple frontmatter including two fields: name and description. Note: Make sure the name in the frontmatter matches exactly the file's name (case sensitive)\n",
    "\n",
    "> **IMPORTANT**: Output styles modify the system prompt that Claude Code has underneath, leaving out the parts focused on software engineering and giving you more control for your specific use case beyond software engineering work."

    "### Feature 3: Plan Mode - Strategic Planning Without Execution\n",
    "\n",
    "**What**: Plan mode instructs the agent to create a detailed execution plan without performing any actions. The agent analyzes requirements, proposes solutions, and outlines steps, but doesn't modify files, execute commands, or make changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why**: Complex tasks benefit from upfront planning to reduce errors, enable review and improve coordination. After the planning phase, the agent will have a red thread to follow throughout its execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How**: Just set `permission_mode=\"plan\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: this feature shines in Claude Code but still needs to be fully adapted for headless applications with the SDK. Namely, the agent will try calling its `ExitPlanMode()` tool, which is only relevant in the interactive mode. In this case, you can send up a follow-up query with `continue_conversation=True` for the agent to execute its plan in context."

    "\n",
    "> Note: slash commands are syntactic sugar for users, not new agent capabilities\n",

    "### Feature 5: Hooks - Automated Deterministic Actions\n",
    "\n",
    "**What**: Hooks are Python scripts that you can set to execute automatically, among other events, before (pre) or after (post) specific tool calls. Hooks run **deterministically**, making them perfect for validation and audit trails.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why**: Imagine scenarios where you want to make sure that your agent has some guardrails (e.g., prevent dangerous operations) or when you want to have an audit trail. Hooks are ideal in combination with agents to allow them enough freedom to achieve their task, while still making sure that the agents behave in a safe way.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How**:\n",
    "- Define hook scripts in `.claude/hooks/` -> _what_ is the behaviour that should be executed when a hook is triggered\n",
    "- Define hook configuration in `.claude/settings.local.json` -> _when_ should a hook be triggered\n",

    "- **Bash Tool**: Used to execute the `hiring_impact.py` script to determine the impact of hiring new engineers\n",
    "- **Memory**: Reads `CLAUDE.md` in directory as context to understand the current budgets, runway, revenue and other relevant information\n",
    "- **Output style**: Different output styles, defined in `chief_of_staff_agent/.claude/output-styles`\n",
    "- **Custom Slash Commands**: Uses the shortcut `/budget-impact` that expands to full prompt defined in `chief_of_staff_agent/.claude/commands`\n",
    "- **Subagents**: Our `/budget_impact` command guides the chief of staff agent to invoke the financial-analyst subagent defined in `chief_of_staff_agent/.claude/agents` \n",
    "- **Hooks**: Hooks are defined in `chief_of_staff_agent/.claude/hooks` and configured in `chief_of_staff_agent/.claude/settings.local.json`\n",
    "    - If one of our agents is updating the financial report, the hook should log this edit/write activity in the `chief_of_staff_agent/audit/report_history.json` logfile\n",
    "    - If the financial analyst subagent will invoke the `hiring_impact.py` script, this will be logged in `chief_of_staff_agent/audit/tool_usage_log.json` logfile\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Plan Mode**: If you want the chief of staff to come up with a plan for you to approve before taking any action, uncomment the commented line below\n",
    "\n",
    "To have this ready to go, we have encapsulated the agent loop in a python file, similar to what we did in the previous notebook. Check out the agent.py file in the `chief_of_staff_agent` subdirectory. \n",

    "## Conclusion",
    "",
    "We've demonstrated how the Claude Code SDK enables you to build sophisticated multi-agent systems with enterprise-grade features. Starting from basic script execution with the Bash tool, we progressively introduced advanced capabilities including persistent memory with CLAUDE.md, custom output styles for different audiences, strategic planning mode, slash commands for user convenience, compliance hooks for guardrailing, and subagent coordination for specialized tasks.",
    "",
    "By combining these features, we created an AI Chief of Staff capable of handling complex executive decision-making workflows. The system delegates financial analysis to specialized subagents, maintains audit trails through hooks, adapts communication styles for different stakeholders, and provides actionable insights backed by data-driven analysis.",
    "",
    "This foundation in advanced agentic patterns and multi-agent orchestration prepares you for building production-ready enterprise systems. In the next notebook, we'll explore how to connect our agents to external services through Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, dramatically expanding their capabilities beyond the built-in tools.",
