description: Review links in changed files for quality and security issues
---

**IMPORTANT**: Only review the files explicitly listed in the prompt above. Do not search for or review additional files.

Review the links in the specified changed files and check for potential issues:

## Link Quality Checks
1. **Broken Links**: Identify any links that might be broken or malformed
2. **Outdated Links**: Check for links to deprecated resources or old documentation
3. **Security**: Ensure no links to suspicious or potentially harmful sites
4. **Best Practices**: 
   - Links should use HTTPS where possible
   - Internal links should use relative paths
   - External links should be to stable, reputable sources

## Specific Checks for Anthropic Content
- Links to Claude documentation should point to the latest versions
- API documentation links should be current
- Model documentation should reference current models, not deprecated ones
- GitHub links should use the correct repository paths

## Report Format
Provide a clear summary with:
- ✅ Valid and well-formed links
- ⚠️ Links that might need attention (e.g., HTTP instead of HTTPS)
- ❌ Broken or problematic links that must be fixed

If all links look good, provide a brief confirmation.

**IMPORTANT: Post your review as a comment on the pull request using the command: `gh pr comment $PR_NUMBER --body "your review content"`**
